# Fast Steiner Trees Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the fast algorithm for Steiner trees introduced in the paper titled "A fast algorithm for Steiner trees" by Kou, L., Markowsky, G., & Berman, L. (1981) published in Acta Informatica.

## Introduction

Steiner Tree Problem is a well-known problem in graph theory where the objective is to find the shortest possible tree that connects a given set of vertices (terminals), along with additional vertices (Steiner points) if necessary. This implementation provides a fast algorithm to solve the Steiner Tree Problem efficiently.

## Requirements
